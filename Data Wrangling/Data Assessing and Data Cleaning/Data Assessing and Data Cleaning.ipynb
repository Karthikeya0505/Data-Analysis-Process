Both are measured in units (shortform 'u'), which is the international unit of measurement and the standard measurement for insulin.\n",
    "- `novodra`: same as above, except for patients that continued treatment with Novodra\n",
    "- `hba1c_start`: the patient's HbA1c level at the beginning of the first week of treatment. HbA1c stands for Hemoglobin A1c. The HbA1c test measures what the average blood sugar has been over the past three months. It is thus a powerful way to get an overall sense of how well diabetes has been controlled. Everyone with diabetes should have this test 2 to 4 times per year. Measured in %.\n",
    "- `hba1c_end`: the patient's HbA1c level at the end of the last week of treatment\n",
    "- `hba1c_change`: the change in the patient's HbA1c level from the start of treatment to the end, i.e., hba1c_start - hba1c_end. For Auralin to be deemed effective, it must be \"noninferior\" to Novodra, the current standard for insulin. This \"noninferiority\" is statistically defined as the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval being less than 0.4% for the difference between the mean HbA1c changes for Novodra and Auralin (i.e. Novodra minus Auralin)."
